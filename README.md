# dLottery
dLottery is a decentralized lottery program. 

The backend of this project is built using Solidity, and the frontend is constructed with React. Rinkeby Test Network is used to test the functionality of the project. Choosing the participant randomly could be less pseudo-random by using Chianlink VRF which will be added in the following weeks (20.01.2022).
